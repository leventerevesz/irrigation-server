# irrigation-server

In this project a computer-based smart irrigation controller has been created. The role of this device is to automate the irrigation of a plant nursery growing evergreen plants. The controller continuously schedules irrigation events from user-defined programs. It is also able to automatically adjust the duration of irrigation events according to weather conditions and available water supply.

This repository contains code for the Python Django based server side program.
